- 👋 Hi, I’m Austin Autrey. I am developer who is trying to learn how to develop again, after a few years out of the game.
- 👀 I’m interested in web3 and all that comes along with that.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, data science, FullStack Javascript, and eventually web3.
- 💞️ In the past I have worked with technologies such as java, C++, the MEAN stack, AWS, and others during my time as an undergrad computer science student, and through internships as both a software engineer and information systems analyst.
- After a few years in sales, I have decided to go back to my roots in my computer science degree, and become a full stack developer.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
Please fill free to reach out by email @AustinAutreyTheDeveloper@gmail.com
- This portfolio is currently empty, but I will be adding past projects I have worked on, as well as my journey through python and full stack javascript.
